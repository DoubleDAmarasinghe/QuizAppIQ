Question1,"Buns were being sold at three prices: one for a penny, two for a penny,
and three for a penny. Some children (there were as many boys as girls) were
given seven pennies to spend on these buns, each child to receive exactly the
same value in buns. Assuming that all buns remained whole, how many
buns, and of what types, did each child receive?"
Question2,"A man persuaded Weary Willie, with some difficulty, to try to work on a
job for thirty days at eight dollars a day, on the condition that he would forfeit ten dollars a day for every day that he idled. At the end of the month
neither owed the other anything, which entirely convinced Willie of the folly
of labor. Can you tell just how many days' work he put in and on how many
days he idled?"
Question3,"A man went into a bank with a thousand dollars, all in dollar bills, and ten
bags. He said, ""Place this money, please, in the bags in such a way that if I
call and ask for a certain number of dollars you can hand me over one
or more bags, giving me the exact amount called for without opening any of
the bags.""
How was it to be done? We are, of course, only concerned with a single
application, but he may ask for any exact number of dollars from one to one
thousand."
Question4,"Seven men engaged in play. Whenever a player won a game he doubled
the money of each of the other players. That is, he gave each player just as
much money as each had in his pocket. They played seven games and,
strange to say, each won a game in turn in the order of their names, which
began with the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. When they had finished it was found that each man had exactly $1.28 in his
pocket. How much had each man in his pocket before play?"
Question5,"Here is a curious question that is more perplexing than it looks at first sight.
Abraham, an infirm old man, undertook to dig a ditch for two dollars. He
engaged Benjamin, an able-bodied fellow, to assist him and share the money
fairly according to their capacities. Abraham could dig as fast as Benjamin
could shovel out the dirt, and Benjamin could dig four times as fast as Abraham could do the shoveling.
How should they divide the money? Of course, we must assume their relative abilities for work to be the same in digging or shoveling."
Question6,"A man left a legacy of $1 ,000.00 to three relatives and their wives. The wives
received together $396.00. Jane received $10.00 more than Catherine, and
Mary received $10.00 more than Jane. John Smith was given just as much as
his wife, Henry Snooks got half as much again as his wife, and Tom Crowe
received twice as much as his wife. What was the Christian name ofeach man's
wife?"
Question7,"A farmer goes to market and buys a hundred animals at a total cost
of $1,000.00. The price of cows being $50.00 each, sheep $10.00 each,
and rabbits 50Â¢ each, how many of each kind does he buy? Most people will
solve this, if they succeed at all, by more or less laborious trial, but there are
several direct ways of getting the solution."
Question8,"If you add the square of Tom's age to the age of Mary, the sum is 62; but
if you add the square of Mary's age to the age of Tom, the result is 176. Can
you say what are the ages of Tom and Mary?"
Question9,"Mrs. Wilson had three children: Edgar, James, and John. Their combined
ages were half of hers. Five years later, during which time Ethel was born,
Mrs. Wilson's age equalled the total of all her children's ages. Ten years more
have now passed, Daisy appearing during that interval. At the latter event
Edgar was as old as John and Ethel together. The combined ages of all the
children are now double Mrs. Wilson's age, which is, in fact, only equal to
that of Edgar and James together. Edgar's age also equals that of the
two daughters.
Can you find all their ages?"
Question10,"At what time are the two hands of a clock so situated that, reckoning
as minute points past XII, one is exactly the square ofthe distance ofthe other?"
